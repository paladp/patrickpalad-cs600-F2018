  abstract={This study analyses the relationship between minimum wages, average wages and employment in the Greek private sector throughout the past decade, using published IKA data on employment and wages, as well as data on minimum statutory wages. It appears that minimum wages affect a substantial proportion of employees in the Greek private sector, especially in certain industries and in small firms (employing less than 10 workers). The analysis shows that minimum wages affect the average wages of both males and females and that increases in minimum wages affect the employment of both genders.},

    abstract = {Background Children exposed to family poverty have been found to have higher morbidity and mortality rates, poorer mental health and cognitive outcomes and reduced life chances across a wide range of life domains. There is, however, very little known about the extent to which poverty is experienced by children over their early life course, particularly in community samples. This study tracks changes in family poverty and the main factors that predict family poverty (adverse life experiences) over a 30-year period since the birth of the study child.   Methods Data are from a prospective, longitudinal, birth cohort study conducted in Brisbane, Australia. Consecutive families were recruited at the mothers’ first obstetrical visit at one of two major obstetrical hospitals in Brisbane. Data are available for 2087 families with complete data at the 30-year follow-up. Poverty was measured using family income at each time point (adjusted for inflation).   Findings Poverty affects about 20% of families at any time point. It is common for families to move in and out of poverty, as their circumstances are affected by such adversities as unemployment and marital breakdown. Over the period of the study about half the families in the study experienced poverty on at least one occasion. Only a very small minority of families experienced persistent poverty over the 30-year duration of the study. Logistic regressions with time lag show that family poverty predicts subsequent adversities and adverse events predict subsequent poverty.   Conclusions Experiences of poverty and adversity are common and may vary greatly over the child’s early life course. In assessing the health consequences of poverty, it is important to distinguish the timing and chronicity of early life course experiences of poverty and adversity.},

abstract={The voluminous literature on minimum wages offers little consensus on the extent to which a wage floor impacts employment. We argue that the minimum wage will impact employment over time through changes in growth rather than an immediate drop in relative employment levels. We show that commonly used specifications in this literature, especially those that include state-specific time trends, will not accurately capture these effects. Using three separate state panels of administrative employment data, we find that the minimum wage reduces job growth over a period of several years. This finding is supported using several empirical specifications.},

    abstract = { Using personnel data from a large US retail firm, I examine the firm’s response to the 1996 federal minimum wage increase. Compulsory increases in average wages had negative but statistically insignificant effects on overall employment. However, increases in the relative wages of teenagers led to significant increases in the relative employment of teenagers, especially younger and more affluent teenagers. Further analysis suggests a pattern consistent with noncompetitive models. Where the legislation affected mainly the wages of teenagers and so was only moderately binding, it led both to higher teenage labor market participation and to higher absolute employment of teenagers. }

 abstract = {We use policy discontinuities at state borders to identify the effects of minimum wages on earnings and employment in restaurants and other low-wage sectors. Our approach generalizes the case study method by considering all local differences in minimum wage policies between 1990 and 2006. We compare all contiguous county-pairs in the United States that straddle a state border and find no adverse employment effects. We show that traditional approaches that do not account for local economic conditions tend to produce spurious negative effects due to spatial heterogeneities in employment trends that are unrelated to minimum wage policies. Our findings are robust to allowing for long-term effects of minimum wage changes.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of health and education on income distribution and poverty in selected Islamic countries. A model of income inequality along with a model of poverty, with same explanatory variables, are specified. In these models, the main variables are income level, health status, the level of education and the level of savings. The models are estimated using a panel data set for 37 Islamic countries covering eight time periods. The results show that boosting the health and education status in Islamic countries will reduce income inequality and poverty in Islamic countries. The results of the empirical examination will help governments in Muslim world to identify areas that need to be improved upon in order to reduce income inequality and alleviate poverty. The paper is the first of its kind, which provides empirical evidence that the health and education status is negatively associated with income inequality and poverty in Islamic countries.},
